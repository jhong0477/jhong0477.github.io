          <h1>TWC Reflection</h1>
          <p>Throughout my time in WRIT 4999, I feel as though my understanding of Technical Writing and Communication has repeatedly been challenged and developed in a way that few other classes have before. This was one of the first classes I’ve had where every other student shared my major, and I found this alone to be massively beneficial in developing my knowledge of the field. As I talked with my classmates about how they planned on incorporating TWC into an area that they were passionate about, I became inspired to seek out a path to doing it myself. I wasn’t too sure of what I wanted to do within TWC until very recently, and the discussions I had in WRIT 4999 were a significant factor in helping me decide. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>I have always thought of myself as a creative person, and I initially chose to major in TWC because I thought it would be a good way of merging my love of technology with my passion for the arts. I developed an interest in user interface design, as it incorporates many concepts from both of these things. As I would discover in my Capstone project, there are an incredible amount of things that need to be taken into consideration when designing a user interface. While I enjoyed the process of developing interfaces because it allowed me to flex my creative muscles, factors like display limitations and accessibility concerns constantly challenged my applied problem solving skills.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Because I desired to work with user interfaces and user experience professionally, I naturally chose to develop my Capstone project around this concept. I wanted to analyze other existing interfaces created by professionals in-depth, in the hopes that I would gain greater insight into the development process. In order to do this, I chose to do a research project based on the standard IMRAD structure. I developed a methodology of research, incorporating a literary analysis of outside sources, elaborated upon my results, and delivered a means of further discussion through a list of heuristics that I had developed appreciation for. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>My ultimate takeaway from WRIT 4999 is that I made the right choice in picking a career in TWC. It helped me in figuring out how to incorporate my previous educational experiences into my chosen major, resulting in professional goals that feel obtainable. My Capstone project proved to be a great way to dip my toes into the field of UI/UX,  and I am very excited to dive further into this career path.
